# Combined Data Structures and Algorithms Program

This program provides a menu-driven approach to perform various operations on different data structures and algorithms. It includes functionalities for:

1. **Array Operations**
   - Insertion of an element at any location
   - Deletion of an element at any location
   - Copying array elements
   - Reversing the elements of an array
   - Merging two sorted arrays into a third array

2. **Singly Linked List Operations**
   - Creation of a singly linked list
   - Insertion of a node at any location
   - Deletion of a node at any location
   - Counting the number of nodes in the list

3. **Stack Operations**
   - Implementing a stack using both array and linked list
   - Operations include Push, Pop, Empty, Full, and Peek

4. **Queue Operations**
   - Implementing a queue using both array and linked list
   - Operations include Create, Enque, Deque, Rear, and Peek

5. **Tree Traversal**
   - Performing pre-order, in-order, and post-order tree traversal algorithms

6. **Search Algorithms**
   - Linear search for an unsorted list
   - Binary search for a sorted list

7. **Sorting Algorithms**
   - Selection Sort
   - Bubble Sort
   - Insertion Sort
   - Merge Sort
   - Quick Sort
   - Radix Sort

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/combined-data-structures-algorithms.git
   ```

2. **Compile the program using a C++ compiler:**

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o program
   ```

3. **Run the executable:**

   ```bash
   ./program
   ```

4. **Follow the on-screen menu to select the desired operation and input data accordingly.**
